# Personnal Keyboard History

In this repository I will try to track down all of the keyboard that I currently own.

The keyboards will be separated by switch type. At the moment I only have [Topre](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Topre_switch) keyboard.
If I have any object that is also related to the keyboard company, I will also add it to the said list.

This repo will also serve me to save good link that I would like to share/save.


# TODO

* Add keyboard that I owned
* Add pictures of Keyboard
